= VS Code Integration

You can use `Trento MCP Server` directly on Visual Studio Code using the GitHub Copilot extension or any compatible LLM client that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows you to interact with the Trento API and execute tools defined in the OpenAPI specification.

== Using VS Code (or compatible LLM clients)

[arabic]
. *Start the Server*
* Build and run the server locally or in a container. For example, type `make run`.
* By default, the server will listen on a specific port (see your configuration or environment variables).
. *Configure Your LLM Client*
* In your LLM tool or VS Code extension, set the MCP server endpoint to point to your running `Trento MCP Server` instance. For example:
** `http://localhost:5000` (replace with your actual host and port)
. *Connect and Use*
* Use the LLM tool or extension as usual. It will communicate with the MCP server for tool execution, context, and API interactions.
* Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl{plus}Shift{plus}P`), search for your LLM extension's settings, and set the MCP server URL to your running instance.
* Ensure the server is accessible from your development environment.

For more details, refer to your LLM tool or extension documentation.

== Example MCP Client Configuration

To connect your LLM client or extension to this MCP server, use a configuration snippet like the following:

[source,json]
----
{
  "servers": {
    "trento": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:5000/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
----

Alternatively, you can use this link to install the server directly in VS Code:
