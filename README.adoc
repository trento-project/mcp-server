== Trento MCP Server
link:{badge-url}[image:{badge-img}[Install in VS Code]]

____
This project is still in very early stages of development and may not be fully functional or stable. For now, it serves as a proof of concept and a starting point for building MCP servers that integrate with the Trento API.
____

The `Trento MCP Server` project introduces a https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction[Model Context Protocol] (MCP) server implementation, enabling Trento to be used and configured as a tool for AI.
Instead of interacting with the Trento server solely through the web UI, you can now interact with it directly from an AI, a chat interface, or an agent.

=== Features

* *OpenAPI-Driven Tool Generation:*
** The server uses the OpenAPI specification in `api/openapi.json` to automatically generate tools and endpoints, ensuring strong alignment between the API contract and implementation.
* *Security & Authentication:*
** Acts as a resource server, enforcing access control and protecting resources.
** Requires a valid Trento API key token for authentication - users must generate this token from their Trento instance.
** The server accepts the API key via HTTP header (default: `X-TRENTO-API-KEY`) and validates it against the target Trento server.
** Delegates authorization to the Trento server, following best practices for secure, standards-based authentication flows.
** Once authentication is successful, the server maintains a session to interact with the Trento API on behalf of the authenticated user.
* *Container-Ready:*
** Includes a Dockerfile for easy containerization and deployment.

=== Quick Start

==== Prerequisites

* Access to a Trento instance
* Trento API key token (generate it from your Trento web interface)
